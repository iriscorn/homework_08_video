                <p>One of the most memorable moments from the movie is when Jesse and Céline are sitting in a randomly discovered cafe, imagining how they will describe each other to their friends. Their conversation can be seen as a summary of all the emotions and feelings they've experienced in just one day spent together. Incredibly romantic.</p>

                <p>If you happen to find yourself in Vienna, but you're just passing through or don't have the funds for accommodation, a great idea is to use this map. It marks every single location where the movie's characters were. It's the perfect way to spend a day in the European capital for someone who doesn't enjoy going to museums or reading brochures. This short journey will feel like an interesting walk or quest. Of course, it would be even more valuable with a good friend or partner, but that's up to you to decide.</p>

                <p>In case you decide to embark on a journey like Jesse and Céline, we highly recommend familiarizing yourself with a few soundtracks from the movie, as they evoke an incredible atmosphere of romance and freedom. Just put on your headphones and feel like you have nowhere to rush, the whole city is yours.</p>

        <p class="footer__review">"Before Sunrise is not a big movie, or one with big ideas, but it is a cut above the banal twentysomething love stories you usually see at the movies. This one, at least, treats young people as real people"

        </p>

        <p class="footer__review">"Before Sunrise is as uneven as any marathon conversation might be, combining colorful, disarming insights with periodic lulls. The film maker clearly wants things this way, with both these young characters trying on ideas and attitudes as if they were new clothes"
